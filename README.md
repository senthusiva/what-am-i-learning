# what-am-i-learning

This repo contains a list/submodules of things I'm learning, such as programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc. I'm using this to keep track of what I'm learning and to help me remember what I've learned.
Each submodule is a small project which contains code from udemy courses, tutorials, and guides.
